# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) 🚀

This repository contains my weekly implementations and analysis of algorithms as part of my **4th Semester CSE curriculum**. As a core branch student, my focus is on mastering time complexity and optimization for **SDE placement preparation**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Week 1 & 2: Basic Sorting & Searching
* **Insertion Sort:** Implementation with counts for comparisons and shifts.
* **Selection Sort:** Implementation with counts for comparisons and swaps.

### Week 3: Analysis of Sorting
* **Stability Analysis:** Notes on the stability of various sorting techniques.
* **Duplicate Detection:** $O(n \log n)$ approach to find duplicates using sorting.

### Week 4: Divide and Conquer
* **Merge Sort:** Recursive approach to count inversions and comparisons.
* **Randomized Quick Sort:** Implementation using a random pivot for $O(n \log n)$ average performance.
* **Quick Select:** Optimized $O(n)$ algorithm to find the Kth smallest element.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Development Environment:** VS Code
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run
To compile and run any of the C++ files, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
g++ "filename.cpp" -o output
./output
